# Postgres Access Layer

This is a simple gRPC service that implements the [Relational](https://github.com/topcoder-platform/plat-interface-definition/tree/main/data-access-layer/relational) interface to talk to Postgres.

# Roadmap

- Add support for transactions
- Add support for batch operations
- Add authentication
- Add a cache layer

# Note

This is in the early stages of development and while it is functional and the interfaces are fully defined, it is not yet ready for production use.
